# Daily log — 2025-11-15

**Date:** 2025-11-15  
**Topic / Concept:** GitHub daily log + README template  
**What I learned (1–3 lines):** Creating a repo makes publishing frictionless. Small daily wins matter more than perfect posts.  
**Problem I solved / experiment I ran:** Set up README template and created first daily post.  
**Command / Code snippet (if any):** `git init && git add . && git commit -m "init daily log"`  
**One mistake I made:** Overthinking whether to start public — just start.  
**Links / References:** —  
**Tomorrow's plan:** Add a short script to auto-create daily files and commit.
